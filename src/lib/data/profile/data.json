  "about": [
    "I've worked across the stack—from frontend development to backend engineering—and I'm now transitioning into DevOps and platform engineering. At Bitmosys, I architected a high-availability ERP infrastructure with Linkerd service mesh and self-managed observability. Currently at Ascend Cloud Services, I'm deploying Kubernetes clusters on AWS and Azure, implementing Databricks for data pipelines, and automating infrastructure with IaC and CI/CD. I work with NixOS for reproducible systems and I'm studying for the Azure System Administrator exam.",
    "When I'm not coding, I enjoy collecting books, catching up on my favorite TV series, and hunting for the best coffee in town."
